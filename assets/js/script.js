//Pseudo Code
//Create a "Start Quiz" button
  //Display a timer and highscore on the page 
//Create a series of questions with four possible answers
  //Display if the question was answered correct or incorrect
  //Incorrect answers affect the total time 
  //User moves through all the questions until they have finished the quiz or the timer reaches zero
//High scores are displayed and stored in local storage  

// Create new HTML file with reusable elements such as:

// // 1. Question container
// // 2. Initials container
// // 3. Timer container

// Create a new JS file with elements such as:

// // 1. Variables to keep track of quiz state
// // 2. Variables to reference DOM elements/elements to be created
// // 3. Sound effects (if you wanna get fancy)         
// // 4. Functions to start quiz, get question, and check answer, control the timer
// // 5. Function to save high scores to local storage
